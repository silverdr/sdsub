- broken SUB files with empty start or end frame do not crash the program anymore

2010-12-12 (silverdr)
=====================
Bugfixes:
- corrected parsing of timecodes from SUB/TXT files
- corrected (actually implemented) parsing of multiple
  body lines from SUB/TXT files

Additions:
- preliminary attributes parsing from / to both SRT and SUB/TXT files.
  Currently only four attributes are being supported (italic, bold, underline, strike)
  and not much is being done in terms of order and nesting verification.
  Attributes are supported currently on a line by line base only. Single words can not
  be attributed, but it seems to be the most common approach anyway.
- line termination sequence can now be specified as either "LF", "CR" or "CRLF"

Other:
- renamed the tool from "sd_sub" to "sdsub" for easier typing
